## Data Programming course

#### Hi, I'm Sam.
*(she/her)*


This repository is for my Data Programming class, in which I am learning best practices for **R and Github**.
There is a "Homework" folder containing my assignments, as well as a "Misc" folder that contains additional learning materials.

#### Bio

I'm a 4th year social psychology PhD student at University of South Florida. I work under Dr. Kristen Salomon in the USF Cardiovascular Psychophysiology lab and I study how women experience ambiguous sexism.
