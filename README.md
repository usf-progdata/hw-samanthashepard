## Data Programming course

#### Hi, I'm Sam.

This repository is for my Data Programming class, in which I am learning best practices for **R and Github**.

#### Bio

I'm a 4th year PhD student at University of South Florida working under Dr. Kristen Salomon in the Cardiovascular Psychophysiology lab.

I'm broadly interested in how women experience ambiguous sexism.
