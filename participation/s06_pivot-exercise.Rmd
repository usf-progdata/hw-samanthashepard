## Exercise 1: Univariate Pivoting

Consider the Lord of the Rings data:

```{r}
lotr
```

1. Would you say this data is in tidy format?

   <!-- Describe why or why not in this space. -->

2. Widen the data so that we see the words spoken by each species, by putting species as its own column.

```{r}


(lotr_wide <- lotr %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(-Species, -Words), 
              names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Words))
#idcols with the (-) sign - which are we NOT pivoting
#OR you can not put a (-) at all to indicate the ones you DO want to pivot
#names_from - takes values from Species category and widens it out so that each unique value from species makes the name of a new column
#values_from - what is the word for the values
#you can use quotation marks to tell it to use string values
```

3. Re-lengthen the wide LOTR data from Question 2 above.

```{r}
lotr_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Elf:Man), 
               names_to  = "species", 
               values_to = "words")

#when you give character values - use quotations
#if you didn't use quotations, R would think that species is an object
```
