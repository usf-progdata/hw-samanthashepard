# Homework 03

You will analyze data looking at the relationship between **green reputation** and three personality traits--**compassion**, **intellectual curiosity**, and **openness to experiences**.
The dataset includes data from **students** and **non-students**.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
dictionary <- readr::read_csv("green_dictionary.csv")
green_data <- readr::read_csv("green_data.csv")
```

For your assignment, do the following.

  1. Inspect the item responses (e.g., with graphs or by summarizing distinct values). 
  
```{r}
summary(green_data)
```
  
     Is anything unusual?
Missing values are coded as -99; below is the code to change the -99 values to "missing."
```{r}
green_data %>% 
mutate(
  across(.cols = everything (),
         ~ na_if(.x, "-99")
  ))

#Notes from class:
#everything = ALL COLUMNS
#~ = opens up for using ".x"
#.x = the current column
```

  2. Compute total scores for the four scales.

```{r}
#not sure if there are any reverse-coded items?
#going to check reliability to see
library(psych)

View(dictionary)
View(green_data)
```


     Recode variables as needed.
     
```{r}
#reverse-code variables




#recode categorical variables
green_data %>%
  mutate(
    student = recode(student, "1" = "not a student", "2" = "student")
  ) %>%
  select(id, student)
```


  3. Rescale the variables so that they go from 0-100 instead of the original range.
     Name the recaled variables `*_pomp`.
  4. Make plots that illustrate the distributions of the 4 POMP-scored variables.
  5. Make scatterplots showing the relationships between **green reputation** and each personality trait.
     Include trend lines for **students** and **non-students**.
     What do these plots show?
  6. Compare **green reputation** for students and non-students using a **rainfall plot** (bar + density + data points).
  7. Compute a summary table of means, SDs, medians, minima, and maxima for the four total scores for students and non-students.
  
In your assignment, prepare an RMarkdown file that includes both the coding and (for 4-7) narrative descriptions of your results.
