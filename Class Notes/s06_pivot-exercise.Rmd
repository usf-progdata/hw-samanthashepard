## Exercise 1: Univariate Pivoting

Consider the Lord of the Rings data:

```{r}
lotr
```

1. Would you say this data is in tidy format?

   <!-- Describe why or why not in this space. -->

2. Widen the data so that we see the words spoken by each species, by putting species as its own column.

```{r}
(lotr_wide <- lotr %>% 
  pivot_wider(FILL_THIS_IN = c(-Species, -Words), 
              FILL_THIS_IN = Species, 
              FILL_THIS_IN = Words))
```

3. Re-lengthen the wide LOTR data from Question 2 above.

```{r}
lotr_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(FILL_THIS_IN = FILL_THIS_IN, 
               names_to  = FILL_THIS_IN, 
               values_to = FILL_THIS_IN)
```
