^^This thing is called "YAML."
sub-options in these arguments need to be nested beneath them.
the theme argument doesn't do anything unless it's indented underneath "html_document."
WHITE SPACE MATTERS IN YAML
If you have a theme set, get rid of "default"
reshape2 package - avoid using this.





You will analyze data looking at the relationship between **green reputation** and three personality traits--**compassion**, **intellectual curiosity**, and **openness to experiences**.
The dataset includes data from **students** and **non-students**.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

dictionary <- readr::read_csv("green_dictionary.csv")
green_data <- readr::read_csv("green_data.csv")

#don't leave "View(dictionary) etc. in code report.
#don't put "print" in code report.
#Make sure that you're keeping in useful output.
#make notes with hashtags and then when you're writing things for your manuscript as regular text.
#You can use backticks in your narrative you type in regular text so that r populates specific numbers and statistics into the regular text for your results section
#never write in working directory code
#geom_jitter - when you're using a continuous variable - make sure you don't use it so that it unnecessarily changes how the data look. or you can use jitter, but make sure you make it so that it doesn't spread the points out too much.
#About # 4 - 
#economize our code with a base plot if you're essentially making the same plot several dif times.
#remove NA from plot - with discrete vbls, it will treat NA as its own category. how to tell it to not do that:
#scale_color_discrete() ... na.translate = FALSE (written in code below)
#below - code that arranges plots together so they look nice
#rainfall plot below


```

For your assignment, do the following.

  1. Inspect the item responses (e.g., with graphs or by summarizing distinct values). 
     Is anything unusual?

```{r}
green_data %>%
  select(-id) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = "item",
               values_to = "response") %>% 
  group_by(item) %>% 
  summarize(unique = paste(unique(response), collapse = " ")) %>% 
  print(n = 36)

(duplicated_ids <- green_data %>% filter(duplicated(id)) %>% pull(id))
```

The main issue that needs to be addressed is that there are values of `-99`, which should be recoded to `NA`.

Some of you also noted that there are several duplicated `id` values. 
This was a quirk (I randomly generated those numbers and there happened to be 10 duplicates), but we can fix that in any case.

```{r cleanup}
green_data <- green_data %>% 
  na_if(-99) %>% # recode -99 to NA
  group_by(id) %>% # for the ids that are duplicated, keep the first non-NA value for each variable
  mutate(
    across(
      everything(),
      ~ first(na.omit(.x))
      )
    ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(! duplicated(id))
```

```{r cleanup-alt, eval=FALSE}
green_data <- green_data %>% 
  na_if(-99) %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(
    across(
      everything(),
      ~ first(na.omit(.x))
      ),
    .groups = "drop"
    
    )

```

  2. Compute total scores for the four scales. 
     Recode variables as needed.
     
```{r total score}
reversed_items <- dictionary %>% 
  filter(Keying < 0) %>% 
  pull(Item)

green_data <- green_data %>% 
  mutate(
    across(
      all_of(reversed_items),
      ~ 6 - .x
    )
  ) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  transmute(
    id = id,
    student = factor(student, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Not a student", "Student")),
    green = mean(c_across(starts_with("green")), na.rm = TRUE),
    comp = mean(c_across(starts_with("comp")), na.rm = TRUE),
    intel = mean(c_across(starts_with("intel")), na.rm = TRUE),
    open = mean(c_across(starts_with("open")), na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r tota score-alt, eval = FALSE}
green_data <- green_data %>% 
  mutate(
    across(
      all_of(reversed_items),
      ~ recode(.x, `1` = 5, `2` = 4, `3` = 3, `4`= 2, `5` = 1)
    )
  ) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    student = factor(student, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Not a student", "Student")),
    green = mean(c_across(green1:green4), na.rm = TRUE),
    comp = mean(c_across(comp1:comp10), na.rm = TRUE),
    intel = mean(c_across(intel1:intel10), na.rm = TRUE),
    open = mean(c_across(open1:open10), na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  select(id, student, green, comp, intel, open)
```

  3. Rescale the variables so that they go from 0-100 instead of the original range.
  
```{r pomp}
green_data <- green_data %>% 
  mutate(
    across(
      green:open,
      ~ scales::rescale(.x, to = c(0, 100), from = c(1, 5)),
      .names = "{.col}_pomp"
    )
  )
```

  4. Make scatterplots showing the relationships between **green reputation** and each personality trait.
     Include trend lines for **students** and **non-students**.
     What do these plots show?
     
```{r scatterplots}
base_plot <- ggplot(green_data) +
  aes(
    y = green_pomp,
    color = student,
    fill = student
  ) +
  geom_jitter(
    alpha = .5,
    height = .5,
    width = .5,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_discrete("Student status", na.translate = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_discrete("Student status", na.translate = FALSE) +
  ylab("Green reputation")

comp_plot <- base_plot +
  aes(x = comp_pomp) +
  xlab("Compassion")

intel_plot <- base_plot +
  aes(x = intel_pomp) +
  xlab("Intellectual curiosity")

open_plot <- base_plot + 
  aes(x = open_pomp) +
  xlab("Openness to experiences")

comp_plot + intel_plot + open_plot + guide_area() +
  plot_layout(ncol = 2, guides = 'collect') +
  plot_annotation(title = "Green reputation relationships with three personality traits")
```

All thre personality traits are positively related to green reputation.
Openness to experience appears to have the strongest relationship.

  5. Compare **green reputation** for students and non-students using a **rainfall plot** (bar + density + data points).
  
```{r rainfall plots}
green_data %>% 
  drop_na(c(student, green_pomp)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(
    x = green_pomp,
    y = student,
    color = student,
    fill = student
  ) +
  geom_jitter(
    alpha = .5,
    height = .2,
    width = .0,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = .1,
    color = "black",
    fill = "transparent"
  ) +
  ggdist::stat_sample_slabinterval(
    alpha = .5,
    height = .2, 
    color = "black",
    position = position_nudge(y = .2)
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Green reputation by student status", 
       y = NULL,
       x = "Green reputation"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot") +
  guides(color = guide_none(), fill = guide_none())
```

Students and non-students appear to have similar distributions of green reputation.
  
  6. Compute a summary table of means, SDs, medians, minima, and maxima for the four total scores for students and non-students.

```{r summary table}
table1 <- green_data %>% 
  drop_na(student) %>% 
  group_by(student) %>% 
  summarize(
    across(
      contains("pomp"),
      list(
        Mean = mean,
        SD = sd,
        Median = median,
        Min = min,
        Max = max
      ),
      na.rm = TRUE
    )
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    -student,
    names_to = c("Variable", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_pomp_"
  ) %>% 
  select(Variable, `Student status` = student, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(Variable = factor(Variable, 
                           levels = c("green", "comp", "intel", "open"), 
                           labels = c("Green reputation", 
                                      "Compassion", 
                                      "Intellectual curiosity", 
                                      "Openness to experiences"
                                      )
                           )
         ) %>% 
  arrange(Variable)

knitr::kable(table1, format = "markdown", digits = 2)
```
